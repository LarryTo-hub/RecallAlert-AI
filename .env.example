# Twilio (optional)
# Twilio is a cloud communications platform (https://www.twilio.com/) that provides APIs
# for sending SMS, MMS and making voice calls. We may want to use Twilio to deliver
# timely SMS alerts directly to users' phones because it's reliable, scalable, and
# supports delivery status callbacks. If you prefer email-to-SMS gateways or webhooks,
# leave these blank.
# Leave blank to disable Twilio sending
